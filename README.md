Standalone PowerShell script allowing sysadmins (or everyone else really) quickly and easily export all folders and subfolders ACL, wether those are applied to security groups or simple users.
I will try to improve it and add features, feel free to create issues, or suggest improvements !      
Here is an example of the output of the script :
